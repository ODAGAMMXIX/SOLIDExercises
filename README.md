Studying S.O.L.I.D. Principles

1) S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or               responsibility.

2) O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for             modification.

3) L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the        functionality of the program.

4) I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.


5) D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions         (e.g., interfaces).
